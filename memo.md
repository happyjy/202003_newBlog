# Welcome to GraphiQL
#
# GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
# testing GraphQL queries.
#
# Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will see intelligent
# typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema and live syntax and
# validation errors highlighted within the text.
#
# GraphQL queries typically start with a "{" character. Lines that starts
# with a # are ignored.
#
# An example GraphQL query might look like:
#
#     {
#       site {
#         siteMetadata {
#           title
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
# Keyboard shortcuts:
#
#  Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button above)
#
#     Merge Query:  Shift-Ctrl-M (or press the merge button above)
#
#       Run Query:  Ctrl-Enter (or press the play button above)
#
#   Auto Complete:  Ctrl-Space (or just start typing)
